===============================

We are in the process of developing a secure smartphone application on the Android platform that implements Certificate Pinning to counter Man-In-The-Middle attacks on SSL connections. The app has a simple UI that allows testing of different URLs for certificate pinning. It also allows user registration with the app, where each user is permitted to register only once by assigning unique user IDs and passwords to each user and generating bearer tokens for authentication. However, users may update other details apart from the username and member ID which are used to distinctly identify registered users.
