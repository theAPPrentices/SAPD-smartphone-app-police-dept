SAPD - Smartphone Application Police Department
===============================
We are in the process of developing a secure smartphone application on the Android platform that implements Certificate Pinning to counter Man-In-The-Middle attacks on SSL connections. 
The app has a simple UI that allows the user to connect to different mail and social networking services. 
However, to demonstrate the concept and main purpose of the project, the certificate pinning mechanism disallows other mail services except GMail.

The future scope of this project is to possibly integrate it on Windows Phone and iOS using Xamarin.
